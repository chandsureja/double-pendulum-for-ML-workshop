# double-pendulum-for-ML-workshop
the purpose of this repo was to use for the ML workshop conducted by Scientific circle for Computational physics. I selected Double pendulum to demostrate the hurldels in modelling a dynamical system. As by nature the systems are very unpredictable. they are also termed as Chaotic systems as a slight change in a intial conditions results in a compleletly different results. However there exist specifically designed Neural nets which can efficently predict the dynamical systems.

I'll try to present different models for modelling a dynamical system starts from the simplest models
